## 🚀 Quick Start - Deploy to Staging Now!

### Step 1: Update Staging Environment File

Edit `src/environments/environment.staging.ts` and add your WooCommerce keys:

```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  staging: true,
  wordpress: {
    baseUrl: 'http://s9d.607.myftpupload.com',
    apiUrl: 'http://s9d.607.myftpupload.com/wp/wp-json/wp/v2',
    woocommerceUrl: 'http://s9d.607.myftpupload.com/wp/wp-json/wc/v3'
  },
  woocommerce: {
    consumerKey: 'YOUR_STAGING_KEY',      // ← Add your key here
    consumerSecret: 'YOUR_STAGING_SECRET'  // ← Add your secret here
  }
};
```

**Where to get keys:**
1. Log into staging WordPress admin
2. WooCommerce → Settings → Advanced → REST API
3. Add Key, set to "Read"
4. Copy Consumer Key and Secret

### Step 2: Build for Staging

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/jefflongo/Projects/StPeteLodge139AngularHeadV1

# Ensure Node 18+

# Build for staging
./build-for-godaddy.sh

npm run build:staging
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Staging

2. **Upload Angular files:**

   - To: `public_html/` on staging server

3. **Configure WordPress:**

   - Update database URLs (see STAGING_DEPLOYMENT.md)
   - Upload CORS plugin

4. **Upload configuration:**
   - Rename `.htaccess.example` to `.htaccess`
   - Upload to `public_html/`

## 🎓 Key Differences: Staging vs Production

### Staging (s9d.607.myftpupload.com):
- Uses HTTP (not HTTPS)
- Separate WooCommerce API keys
- Safe to experiment
- No impact on live site
- Test all features here first

### Production (stpetelodge139.org):
- Uses HTTPS (SSL required)
- Production API keys
- Public-facing
- Careful deployment required
- Only after staging approval

**Good luck with your staging deployment!** 🚀
