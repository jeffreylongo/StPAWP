## ⚡ Quick Build & Deploy

### 1. Update Configuration (One Time Setup)

Edit `src/environments/environment.staging.ts`:
```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  staging: true,
  wordpress: {
    baseUrl: 'http://s9d.607.myftpupload.com',
    apiUrl: 'http://s9d.607.myftpupload.com/wp/wp-json/wp/v2',
    woocommerceUrl: 'http://s9d.607.myftpupload.com/wp/wp-json/wc/v3'
  },
  woocommerce: {
    consumerKey: 'YOUR_STAGING_KEY',      // Get from staging WordPress
    consumerSecret: 'YOUR_STAGING_SECRET'  // Get from staging WordPress
  }
};
```

### 2. Build for Staging

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/jefflongo/Projects/StPeteLodge139AngularHeadV1

# Switch to Node 18
nvm use 18.20.2

# Run the staging build script
./build-for-godaddy.sh

# OR manually:
npm run build:staging
```

### 3. Upload to Staging

**Files to upload:** `dist/stpete-lodge139-angular-head-v1/browser/*`

**Upload to:** `s9d.607.myftpupload.com` public_html/ folder

**Methods:**
- FTP (FileZilla): Connect to `s9d.607.myftpupload.com`

### 4. Configure WordPress on Staging

**Move WordPress to /wp subdirectory:**
```bash

mkdir wp
mv [all-wordpress-files] wp/
```

**Update WordPress URLs in database:**
```sql
UPDATE wp_options 
SET option_value = 'http://s9d.607.myftpupload.com/wp' 
WHERE option_name IN ('siteurl', 'home');
```

**Upload CORS plugin:**

## 🎯 Moving from Staging to Production

**Only after staging is fully tested:**

1. **Update Production Environment:**

    consumerSecret: 'PROD_SECRET'
  }
};
```

2. **Build for Production:**
```bash
npm run build:prod
```

3. **Deploy to Production:**
- SSH: `y91.b3b.myftpupload.com`
- Follow same steps as staging
- Use HTTPS URLs for production

## 🆘 Quick Troubleshooting

### "Can't connect to staging site"
- Check FTP credentials
- Verify server is `s9d.607.myftpupload.com`
- Try cPanel File Manager instead

### "WordPress shows 404"
- Check database URLs: `SELECT * FROM wp_options WHERE option_name IN ('siteurl', 'home');`
- Should be: `http://s9d.607.myftpupload.com/wp`

### "CORS error in console"
- Verify `wordpress-cors-plugin.php` is uploaded
- Location: `wp/wp-content/mu-plugins/`
- Check plugin has correct staging URL

### "Products don't load"
- Update WooCommerce API keys in `environment.staging.ts`
- Get keys from staging WordPress (not production!)
- Rebuild: `npm run build:staging`
